hubba
=====

Hubba is a lightweight service bus built for front end developers to easily create a restful service bus that auto-generates a .js file for interaction, and documentation for other developers. Initial adapters for resources include mysql, postgresql, rest proxy, soap web services, static files, emails, and a custom adapter (controller) allowing for writing javascript on the server.
