hubba
=====

Hubba is a lightweight service bus built for front end developers to easily create a restful service bus that auto-generates a .js file for interaction, and documentation for other developers. Initial adapters for resources include mysql, postgresql, rest proxy, soap web services, static files, emails, and a custom adapter (controller) allowing for writing javascript on the server.


General Philosophy
-----

- Javascript is great
- Front-end developers are great
- Rest-ful API's are great
- Lightweight middleware is great
- Client side generated HTML is great
- Plain ol' SQL is great
- Auto-documentation is great
- Auto-generated javascript to interact with the api is great
- AngularJS is great, so are other frameworks and those should get their own plugins
- Built-in testing is great
- Built-in logging is great
- Simple deployment is great
- Serving static files is great
- Multiple ways to handle authentication is great
- Web development is great
- ORM frameworks can be great, but most likely won't be included
- Server side html can be great, but is left out
- Java,PHP,Python, etc... are all great, but don't have much place here
- MVC is great, but the goal with Hubba is to keep everything service oriented


Requirements
-----
Nodejs + Nginx

Notes
-----
This is still early in implementation, right now you can build out your resource tree, and REST and SOAP proxies are working.
